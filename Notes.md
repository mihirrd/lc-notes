## Analysis of Algorithms

### Asymptotic Analysis
- The idea is to measure the order of growth.
- Does not depend on the machine or language. 
- How the code performs depending on the size of the input. 

### Order of growth
A function f(n) is said to be growing faster than g(n) if : 
$
\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} f(n) / g(n) = 0
$

### Asymptotic Notations 
$
O(n) : \text{Exact or Upper bound}
\\
\theta (n) : \text{Exact}
\\
\omega (n) : \text{Exact or Lower bound}
$
